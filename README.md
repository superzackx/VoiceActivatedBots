# VoiceActivatedBots

Voice activated bots! The name explains it. 🤖🐥🤖

## Usage

To use, simply download the files and then open the ```test.html``` file in your browser. It will show an request for microphone, accept that. All the logic and JavaScript is in ```app.js```

Or you can use the CDN version which offers everything except for the latest OOP version.
